Switch Connector
================

Inside the switch box, there needs to be some simple wiring that connects
the switches to the IDC-10 connector towards the Pi, provides a screw-terminal
for the large mains-relay and internal connections to wire up a standard
low-voltage relay. To simplify that and improve maintainability, this is a
small PCB inside the switch box.
